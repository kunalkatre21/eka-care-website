### **Why Integrate with EkaScribe?**

Bring intelligent, hands-free clinical documentation into your app or workflow:

* **Voice Dictation & Ambient Listening**  
   Capture speech during consultations—EkaScribe transcribes it live and structures it into clinical notes.

* **Engineered for Indian Healthcare**  
   Trained on medical speech, accents, and Indian terminology, with noise-filtering capabilities. Supports code-mixing and rich medical context.

* **Custom Audio LLM-Powered Accuracy**  
   Built on Eka’s Parrotlet models, it consistently outperforms general speech engines in medical accuracy benchmarks.

* **Automated Structured Output**  
   Beyond raw transcription, EkaScribe extracts entities, links them to medical structures (beyond SOAP formats), and outputs EMR-friendly documentation.

### **Quick Overview of Integration Workflow**

1. **Authentication**  
    Use Eka Connect to obtain `access_token` and `refresh_token`. Include the token in all EkaScribe calls.

**(Optional) Register Webhook**  
 Set a webhook to get notified when transcription is done:

2. **Submit Audio**  
    Use SDK methods like `initTransaction`, `startRecording`, `pauseRecording`, `resumeRecording`, `endRecording` to process the audio.  
3. **Receive Output**  
    The audio is transcribed, entities are extracted, and structured documentation (like EMR-format or clinical notes) is returned post-processing.
